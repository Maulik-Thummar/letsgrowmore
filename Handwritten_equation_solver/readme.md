## Description
The Handwritten Equation Solver is a project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize and solve handwritten mathematical equations. The project focuses on recognizing various mathematical symbols and operators from the given dataset and then using them to solve equations. It serves as a simple example of applying deep learning techniques to real-world problems.

## Dataset
The project uses the "[Handwritten Math Symbols Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols)" from Kaggle. This dataset contains a collection of handwritten symbols and operators commonly found in mathematical equations. Make sure to download and prepare the dataset before using the project.
