# Handwriting Recognition Neural Network

![Handwriting Recognition]

## Project Overview

The **Handwriting Recognition Neural Network** project aims to develop a neural network capable of accurately recognizing and classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for training and evaluating machine learning models in the field of image recognition and classification.

The project will involve the following steps:

1. **Dataset Acquisition**: The MNIST dataset is available through the provided [dataset link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) on Wikipedia. The dataset consists of a large number of grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Before feeding the data into the neural network, it will need to be preprocessed. This may involve tasks such as resizing, normalization, and flattening the images.

3. **Neural Network Architecture**: Design and implement a neural network architecture suitable for image classification tasks. This will involve selecting the appropriate number of layers, types of layers (convolutional, pooling, dense), activation functions, and output layers.

4. **Model Training**: Train the neural network using the preprocessed dataset. This will involve feeding the training data into the network, adjusting the model's parameters through backpropagation, and optimizing the model to achieve the best possible accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using validation and testing datasets. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be used to assess the model's effectiveness.

6. **Inference**: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen handwritten digit images.
