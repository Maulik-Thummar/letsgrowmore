# Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

![Decision Tree](decision_tree_image.jpg) <!-- Replace with an image related to your project -->

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the implementation and usage of the Decision Tree algorithm for making predictions. The Decision Tree algorithm is a popular machine learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, I will use the algorithm to predict [provide a brief description of what you are predicting] based on the provided dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset for my project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Iq7YvbWZbt8VXjfm06brx66b10YiwK-/view). It contains [briefly describe the dataset, e.g., features, target variable, etc.].
