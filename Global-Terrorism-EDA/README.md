Welcome to the Global Terrorism Dataset Analysis repository. This project delves into the Global Terrorism Database, offering insights and visualizations to better understand the patterns, trends, and impacts of terrorism worldwide.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the [Global Terrorism Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1luTU7xBvI7QAGPbQMxEHcgKUi9d6UeP_/view), which contains a rich collection of incidents related to terrorism. This dataset includes details such as attack locations, dates, attack types, targets, casualty counts, and more.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset undergoes thorough cleaning and formatting to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** An in-depth exploration of the dataset provides initial insights into incident distributions, attack types, temporal trends, and more.
- **Geospatial Mapping:** Incidents are mapped onto a world map, providing a clear visual representation of terrorism hotspots and global distribution.
- **Trend Identification:** Key trends are identified, visualized, and discussed, including spikes in incidents and shifts in attack methods.
- **Target Analysis:** A detailed examination of frequently targeted types of locations and institutions helps understand terrorist motivations.
- **Casualty Patterns:** Patterns of casualties are studied, highlighting regions that have been most affected by terrorism.
